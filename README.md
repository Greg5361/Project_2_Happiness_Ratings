# Project_3_Happiness_Ratings
2021_Happiness_Ratings

Hina Abidi and Greg Andres

The data set we dove into showed the happiness ratings for 2021.  We couldn't think of a better data set to review after such a difficult 2020.  Our initial findings ranked happiness, generosity, and healthy life expectancy.  We grouped this by region and displayed our findings on an interactive web page.

We think it would be intersting to dive into why people are happy and see if average income, healtcare, or food security.
